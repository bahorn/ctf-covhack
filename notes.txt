Howdy Friendos!

This is small CTF we have going as a side event!

How it works:
* Send @Beowulf the flags as you get them! Lets me track who got what, etc.
* There is a small prize! You'll get it in the closing ceromony!
* Challenges are setup like a small network, with 4 machines. Go one by one and compromise them all! They'll lead to each other.
* All linux machines and there is no need to use any public exploits! I've provided the tools you'd need on the machines to simplify things.
* Play nice and don't mess with the challenges! I can respawn everything if something breaks.
* I did firewall the boxes so that they can't talk on the internet!
